# SilentRay Distributed Rendering Manager  
## Description:  
An application providing the capability of rendering images using the SilentRay ray tracer
 over multiple PC's. The SilentRay ray tracer started out as a university project for a
 computer graphics course. After the project team decided to continue the project after the
 course had ended, the need for a faster way of rendering arose. And thus this project was born.
